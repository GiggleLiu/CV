\section*{Research interest \& experience}
I am interested in using and developing numeric methods for \textbf{tensor networks}, \textbf{quantum simulation} and \textbf{machine learning},
to solve valuable problems in the cross discipline of quantum physics and computer sciences.
I am the maintainer of several open source projects (listed at the end of this CV), as well as the organizer of \href{http://num.v2nobel.com}{numeric club} and \href{https://github.com/QuantumBFS/}{QuantumBFS}.

I list my research experiences in the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [1] Inspired by the beautiful algorithms of quantum computation,
        I spent one year in Prof. Yang Yu's group learning quantum computation and quantum information in 2012-2013. Yu is a nice advisor, but I like theories and numerics more than experiments.
    \item [2] The next 4 years in NanJing University, I studied in Prof. Qiang-Hua Wang's group. I mastered tensor networks algorithms and renormalizationing group theories, and became a geek in simulating quantum many body systems. Most of my works are about designing creative numeric algorithms to solve really important problems like multi-channel Kondo problem and fractional topological excitations.
    \item [3] I won the first prize in ZTE fantastic algorithm that worth \$15,000 in 2017 as a doctor candidate, which is a good proof of my solid algorithmic background of matrix computation, optimization algorithms and combinatorial optimization. Then I became a postdoc of that young and charming guy Lei-Wang, the most smart and nice advisor I have ever met. He is not only helpful to my research, but also creates a lot of opportunities for me to give lectures and talks in international meetings and summer schools.
    \item [4] Now, it is the second year of my postdoc career in IOP, CAS. My research interest is quantum machine learning, this is a field that can incubate several killer apps. With the help of Lei Wang, I am able to do some sounding works in this field. Especially, he is one of the strongest supporters of I and Xiu-Zhe Luo's quantum differentiable learning framework Yao.jl.
\end{itemize}
