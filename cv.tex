    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
        {
        Recent progress in variational quantum algorithms shows the potential of using Rydberg atom arrays to solve the maximum independent set (MIS) problem defined on diagonal-coupled unit-disk grid graphs.
    We propose a scheme to reduce the problem of finding an MIS of a general graph $G$ to these graphs with highly restricted geometry to boost the power of these quantum algorithms.
          The mapped graph has an overhead bounded by $4 {\rm pw}(G)$, where ${\rm pw}(G)$ is the path width of graph $G$.
    We show the proposed mapping scheme is optimal up to a constant if there are no sub-exponential algorithms for finding an MIS of a general graph.
    Understanding its value to quantum algorithms, we patented it.

    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
      {We introduce a tensor network algorithm %a method that combines generic programming and tensor network techniques
to compute various solution space properties of a class of combinatorial optimization problems on graphs that can be rephrased as satisfiability problems of constraints over local sets of vertices, including the independent set problem, the maximum cut problem, the vertex coloring problem, the maximal clique problem, the dominating set problem, and the satisfiability problem, among others.
We look at the independent set problem as an example, and show how to compute the size of the maximum independent set, count the number of independent sets of a given size, and enumerate/sample the independent sets of a given size.
By using generic programming techniques, %which require a program to work correctly for different input data types without sacrificing efficiency,
the same simple-to-implement framework can be used to compute all of these properties. Our algorithm utilizes recent advances in tensor network contraction techniques to achieve high performance, including methods to quickly find a near-optimal contraction order and slicing.
          To demonstrate how our versatile tool helps to understand these hard problems, we apply it to a few examples, including computing the entropy constant for several hardcore gases on disordered lattices, studying the Overlap Gap Property on unit disk graphs and regular graphs, and analyzing the performance of quantum and classical optimization algorithms for the independent set problem.}
