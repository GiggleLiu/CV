\section*{Research interest \& experience}
I am a computational quantum physicsist. Armed with solid background of both quantum physics and computer science, I am able to solve some valuable problems in the cross discipline of quantum physics and computer sciences.
I am also the maintainer of several open source projects (listed at the end of this CV), as well as an organizer of \href{https://github.com/QuantumBFS/}{QuantumBFS} and \href{http://num.v2nobel.com}{numeric club}.
I list my research experiences as the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [1] When I was a college student, I read a book named "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Michael A. Nielsen.
        I was deeply impressed by the beautiful computation framework in the book, and decided to learn more about quantum computing in Prof. Yang Yu's group in Nanjing University.
    \item [2] After one year, I was transferred to Prof. Qiang-Hua Wang's group since I was more interested in theories and numerical simulations rather than experiments. I mastered tensor networks algorithms and renormalizationing group theories, and became a geek in simulating quantum many body systems. Most of my works are about designing numeric algorithms to solve important problems in physics, like multi-channel Kondo problem and fractional topological excitation.
    \item [3] In the last year as a doctor candidate, I won the first prize in ZTE fantastic algorithm challenge, which is a good proof of my solid algorithmic background of matrix computation and combinatorial optimization. Then I became a postdoc of a young and charming guy Lei-Wang. Besides providing valuable suggestions in my research, Lei also creates a lot of opportunities for me, like encouraging me to give lectures and talks in international meetings and summer schools.
    \item [4] Now is the second year of my postdoc career in Institute of Physics (IOP), Chinese Academy of Sciences. My current research interest is quantum machine learning, this is a field that can incubate several killer Apps. I have not only published several sounding papers in this field, but also developed the quantum differentiable learning framework \href{https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl}{Yao.jl} together with a genuine Julia lover Xiu-Zhe Luo.
\end{itemize}
