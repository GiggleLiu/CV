\section*{Research interest \& experience}
I am a computational quantum physicsist. Armed with solid background of both quantum physics and computer science, I am able to solve some valuable problems in the cross discipline of quantum physics and computer sciences.
I am also the maintainer of several open source projects (listed at the end of this CV), as well as an organizer of \href{https://github.com/QuantumBFS/}{QuantumBFS}.
I list my research experiences as the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [1] When I was a college student, I read a book "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Michael A. Nielsen.
        I was deeply impressed by the beautiful computation framework in the book, and decided to learn more about quantum computing in Prof. Yang Yu's group in Nanjing University.
    \item [2] After one year, I was transferred to Prof. Qiang-Hua Wang's group since I was more interested in theories and numerical simulations rather than experiments. I mastered tensor networks algorithms and renormalizationing group theories, and became a geek in simulating quantum many body systems. Most of my works are about designing numeric algorithms to solve important problems in physics, like multi-channel Kondo problem and fractional topological excitation.
    \item [3] In the last year as a doctor candidate, I won the first prize in ZTE fantastic algorithm challenge, which is a good proof of my solid algorithmic background of matrix computation and combinatorial optimization. Then I became a postdoc of a young and charming guy \href{http://wangleiphy.github.io/}{Lei-Wang}. Besides providing valuable suggestions in my research, Lei also creates a lot of opportunities for me, like encouraging me to give lectures and talks in international conferences and summer schools.
    \item [4] My postdoc career is in Institute of Physics (IOP), Chinese Academy of Sciences. That time my research interest is automatic differentiation and quantum algorithms, this is a field that can incubate several killer Apps. I also developed the quantum simulation framework \href{https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl}{Yao.jl} with a built in automatic differention engine together with a genuine Julia lover \href{http://blog.rogerluo.me/}{Xiu-Zhe Luo}.
    \item [5] I mentored a student for Julia on the \href{https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/}{GSoC} project of differentiable tensor networks. It is a valuable experimence for me to lead a project. The open source repository \texttt{OMEinsum} is listed bellow.
    \item [6] Now I am full participated in reversible Turing machine. It can solve the most important problem in differential programming, the genuine automatic differentiation.
\end{itemize}
